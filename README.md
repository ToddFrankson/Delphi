Delphi Rocks was written in Delphi 2 I believe. John Ayres wrote it. Proof of Delphi's longetivity and code continuity.
The only change I made were to the Uses clauses (Update the Units to Delphi 12) and changed the hardcoded screen size (non sizable form)
to allow for full screen play.

Compiled just fine and runs great

 **  There are a number of people in the Delphi community pushing the idea that Delphi is   **
 **  a great platform for making games.  I wholeheartedly agree with this idea.  I've       **
 **  programmed in C for a number of years, but I've found that not only can Delphi do      **
 **  everything that C can, but it can things done in less time.  What used to take months  **
 **  to do in C, I can do in 2 weeks with Delphi.  Games are no exception.  DirectX is      **
 **  becoming the defacto standard in game development, and Delphi has full access to this  **
 **  API.  Although this program does not use DirectX, it demonstrates that you can make    **
 **  a game with a large number of sprites moving about the screen using only high level    **
 **  Object Pascal and Windows API functions and still get a good frame rate.  I hope that  **
 **  sometime in the near future some entrepreneurial company will take the plunge and use  **
 **  Delphi as the development platform for a best selling game.  Delphi could kick more    **
 **  titles out in a year than a comparable team using C, it's just a matter of time        **
 **  before somebody realizes that fact.                                                    **
 **                                                                                         **
 **  Take this game and improve it.  I want to see Delphi become the game programming       **
 **  platform of choice for Windows games.  If enthusiastic Delphi programmers keep showing **
 **  the C world that Delphi is a great games development platform, changes could happen.   **
